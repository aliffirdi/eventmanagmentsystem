What is Event Management System
###################

Event Management System is an Application Development Under Codeigniter Framework for people
who build Event management System using PHP language. Its goal is to enable you to develop event
much faster than you could if you were create event mannually, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. Event Management System lets
you creatively focus on your event by minimizing the amount of task needed
for a given event.
